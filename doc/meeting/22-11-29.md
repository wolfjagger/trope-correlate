Plans for today:
Trystan - More scraper: captcha and refactoring
Joe - Site with graph, database, or show rough data shape

Scraper - Good progress & good trajectory
Site - Dummy site with tabs working
Briefly discussed graph display possibilities
Captcha roadblock
Pull request problem - T can't review
Filled out taiga with detailed scraper & misc issues
J uncertain what to work on
Decided graph or sketching rough shape of scrape data & storage
MAYBE start database
WASM graph unblocked bc dummy website is up
